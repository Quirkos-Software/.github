## 🧠 Overview

**Quirkos** is a Windows-focused application designed for qualitative research and text-based data analysis. It helps users explore interviews, transcripts, survey responses, and documents by visually organizing themes and patterns in an intuitive workspace.

Instead of complex menus and steep learning curves, Quirkos emphasizes clarity and accessibility. Data is coded using interactive topic bubbles, making it easier to identify relationships, compare ideas, and track emerging insights as analysis progresses.

Quirkos is widely used in academic research, social sciences, UX research, and policy studies. Its visual approach allows Windows users to focus on interpretation and meaning rather than technical complexity.
